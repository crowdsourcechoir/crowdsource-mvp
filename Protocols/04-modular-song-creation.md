Stage 4 — Modular Song Creation
Purpose

Create original, performance-ready material inside a tightly controlled container.
Audience participates through constrained choice, not open improvisation.
This stage generates a repeatable song structure that can scale to 50–1000 people.

Inputs

Pre-selected chord bed (fixed progression)

Two melody variants (A/B, rhythm-validated)

Two lyric options per section (A/B, meter-locked)

Predefined tempo

Leader cue authority

Optional:

Audience-submitted text clips (pre-screened)

Sample slots (pre-mapped rhythm positions)

Control Variables

Chord progression does not change

Tempo locked

Voting window < 30 seconds

Only binary choices (A/B)

Leader resolves ties instantly

No crowd-generated rhythm

No open-mic improvisation

Participation Pattern

Leader teaches Hook A

Leader teaches Hook B

Crowd votes (hands / sound level / digital)

Winning hook locked

Repeat for verse lyric option

Full group repetition

Optional: insert controlled sample slot

Participation is structured selection, not invention.

Musical Constraints

Max 4 chords

Hook length 4–8 bars

Predictable phrase endings

Singable range (avoid extreme highs)

Repetition before variation

No melodic complexity beyond mass retention

Tech Hooks (Ableton / Spatial / Lights / Haptics)

Scene 1: Hook A

Scene 2: Hook B

Scene 3: Verse A

Scene 4: Verse B

Scene 5: Full Song Loop

Scene 6: Sample Insert

Scene 7: Build Transition

Spatial:

Wider field during teaching

Center focus during full unison

Lighting:

Color shift on winning vote

Intensity increase during lock-in

Haptics:

Subtle pulse during vote

Stronger pulse on drop to full loop

Outputs

One complete, repeatable song structure

Locked hook

Locked verse lyric

Repeatable arrangement (exportable)

Audience ownership without chaos

Failure Modes

Crowd energy too low

Confusion between A/B options

Voting indecision

Melody too complex

Leader over-explains

Recovery Moves

Shorten voting window

Default to Hook A

Strip back to unison repetition

Reduce harmonic complexity

Move to full-loop early

Transition directly to Stage 6 if energy spikes
