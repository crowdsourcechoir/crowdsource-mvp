# Protocol: What we are building

We are not building “a song.”
We are building a repeatable container that can generate:
- a full 7-section arc show
- or a smaller one-song version

The protocol is a set of modules:
- Section modules (each part of the show)
- Song modules (hook + chords + lyric options)
- Participation modules (call/response, A/B voting, sampling)
- Tech mapping modules (Ableton scenes, outputs, spatial mapping, haptics/lights)

## Show Arc Protocol v0.1 (7 Stages)
### The 7 Stages (modular backbone)

1. **Arrival + Calibration**  
   Purpose: Set tone, regulate nervous systems, unify attention.  
   Default: ~10 min (expandable)

2. **Collective Activation**  
   Purpose: Engage voices early with simple, repeatable participation.  
   Default: ~15 min (expandable)

3. **Crowd-Proof Hooks Medley**  
   Purpose: Build trust with familiar, guaranteed participation moments.  
   Default: ~15 min (fixed)

4. **Modular Song Creation**  
   Purpose: Create original structured material inside a container.  
   Default: ~20 min (expandable)

5. **Genre Shift**  
   Purpose: Reinterpret shared material across genres to expand range.  
   Default: ~15 min (expandable)

6. **EDM / Choir-DJ Peak**  
   Purpose: High-energy climax with drops, loops, and audience samples.  
   Default: ~20 min (expandable)

7. **Return / Blessing / Release**  
   Purpose: Integrate, ground, and close the experience coherently.  
   Default: ~10 min (fixed)

### Notes
- This backbone must support **both**:
  - **One-song ceremonies** (use only Stage 4, optionally 1 + 7)
  - **Full 2-hour shows** (extend stages marked expandable)
- Each stage becomes a module with its own outputs later (lyrics, Suno anthem, clips, cues, spatial routing, haptics/lighting triggers).
