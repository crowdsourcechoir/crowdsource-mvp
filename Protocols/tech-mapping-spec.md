Tech Mapping Specification (v0.1)

This document defines how the Protocol maps to Ableton, spatial audio, lighting, and haptics.

The tech must follow the structure.
The structure must not follow the tech.

If a tech feature cannot map cleanly to a stage, it is not used.

1. Global Rules

Tempo controlled at master level only

No tempo drift

No scene contains structural ambiguity

Every stage has a default fallback scene

Scenes are labeled by Stage number

Naming Convention:

S1-Arrival-A
S2-Activation-A
S3-Hooks-1
S4-Hook-A
S4-Hook-B
S4-Verse-A
S4-Verse-B
S4-FullLoop
S4-SampleInsert
S5-GenreShift-1
S6-Build
S6-Drop
S7-Return


No creative naming. Functional only.

2. Stage 4 Mapping (Core Engine)

Required Scenes:

S4-Hook-A

S4-Hook-B

S4-Verse-A

S4-Verse-B

S4-FullLoop

S4-SampleInsert

S4-Build

Scene Behavior Rules:

Each Hook scene = identical chord bed

Only melody + lyric change

Drum pattern consistent between A/B

No hidden FX surprises

Sample Insert Scene:

Pre-mapped audio track

Quantization locked to 1 bar

No free recording without grid

Clip auto-loops on trigger

3. Clip Structure

Track Groups:

Harmonic Bed (Pads / Keys)

Rhythm Bed (Kick / Snare / Perc)

Bass

Lead Guide Vocal (Muted during full crowd)

FX / Risers

Sample Capture Track

Click (if needed, routed privately)

No more than 8 core tracks in Stage 4.

If more are needed, the song is too complex.

4. Spatial Routing Rules

Unison = wide stereo field

Teaching phase = slightly narrowed field

Sectional split = spatialized left/right or depth mapping

Drop = expanded low-frequency field

Spatial changes must align with stage transitions only.

No constant spatial motion.

5. Lighting Mapping

Each stage has one base palette:

S1 – Warm low light
S2 – Brighter neutral
S3 – Dynamic multi-color
S4 – Focused + reactive
S5 – Palette shift per genre
S6 – High contrast + strobe moments
S7 – Warm narrow field

Lighting transitions occur only at scene changes.

No random changes mid-scene.

6. Haptics (If Used)

Allowed:

Pulse reinforcement on downbeat

Sub-bass reinforcement on drop

Voting window pulse

Not Allowed:

Constant vibration

Unmapped texture feedback

Randomized pattern shifts

Haptics must reinforce rhythm, not distract from it.

7. Fallback Protocol

Every stage must have:

A minimal scene (pads + light percussion only)

A no-sample version

A no-FX version

If tech fails:

Drop to harmonic bed only

Maintain tempo manually

Continue participation vocally

Remove voting until stabilized

The show must survive without visuals.

8. Scalability Rule

If the tech requires more than:

1 primary operator

1 lighting sync

1 spatial preset change per stage

It is too complex.

Protocol over spectacle.
