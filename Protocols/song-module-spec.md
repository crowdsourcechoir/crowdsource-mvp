Song Module Specification (v0.1)

This document defines the non-negotiable structure for any song used inside Stage 4.

If a song does not meet these constraints, it does not enter the system.

1. Harmonic Structure

Maximum 4 chords

Loop-based progression (cyclical, not linear)

No modulation

No key changes

Progression must function as infinite loop

Examples:

I – V – vi – IV

i – VI – III – VII

I – IV – I – V

2. Tempo Constraints

Must sit between 85–115 BPM for core modular creation

EDM adaptation allowed later (Stage 6)

Tempo must support clear downbeat emphasis

3. Hook Requirements

4–8 bars

Strong rhythmic identity

Repetition within first 30 seconds

Melodic range within singable mass register

Clear phrase ending cadence

Hook must survive 10 repetitions without fatigue.

4. Lyric Constraints

6–8 syllables per line (preferred)

Clear stress pattern

No complex metaphor density

No narrative dependence

Phrase must stand alone

Avoid:

Dense poetic abstraction

Rapid syllable stacking

Unpredictable rhythmic phrasing

5. A/B Variant Rules

Every song must include:

Hook A (fully viable)

Hook B (fully viable)

Both fit same chord progression

Both identical rhythmic length

Neither option can be “weaker.”

6. Structural Simplicity

Required format:

Hook

Verse (optional)

Hook

Loop expansion

No bridges.
No breakdowns (handled in Stage 6).
No surprise structural pivots.

7. Scalability Test

Before approval, the song must pass:

Can 300 people learn it in under 3 minutes?

Can it loop for 5 minutes without harmonic fatigue?

Can it survive genre transformation?

Can it be dropped into EDM grid without rewrite?

If any answer is no, it fails.

8. Leader Load Rule

If the leader must explain the song more than 20 seconds, it is too complex.
