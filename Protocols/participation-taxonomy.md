Participation Taxonomy (v0.1)

This document defines all allowed audience interaction types within the Protocol.

If a participation mode is not listed here, it is not permitted inside the system.

Participation must be structured, time-bound, and leader-governed.

Core Principle

Audience members choose within designed frames.
They do not invent structure.
They do not control rhythm.
They do not override tempo.

Leader maintains structural authority at all times.

Tier 1 — Foundational Modes (Always Allowed)

These are safe at any scale (50–1000 people).

1. Unison Repeat

Definition:
Entire group repeats a taught phrase together.

Constraints:

Phrase ≤ 8 bars

No harmony required

Repeated minimum 2 times before variation

Use Case:
Activation, lock-in, recovery move.

2. Call and Response (Leader-Controlled)

Definition:
Leader sings line. Crowd repeats exact line.

Constraints:

Identical rhythm

No improvisation

≤ 6 exchanges before loop

Use Case:
Energy ramp, clarity building.

3. A/B Selection (Binary Choice)

Definition:
Crowd chooses between two pre-built options.

Voting Methods:

Raised hands

Volume measurement

Digital poll

Physical side-of-room shift

Constraints:

Voting window ≤ 30 seconds

Leader resolves tie instantly

No third option

Use Case:
Stage 4 hook selection, lyric choice.

4. Sectional Split (Predefined)

Definition:
Room divided into 2–3 groups.

Constraints:

Parts pre-written

Rhythm identical across sections

No improvisation

No more than 3 layers

Use Case:
Build energy, spatial activation.

Tier 2 — Structured Expansion Modes (Use Carefully)

Allowed, but require control and cue clarity.

5. Dynamic Control (Volume Sculpting)

Definition:
Leader controls volume rise/fall.

Constraints:

Tempo never changes

No rhythmic variation

Clear gesture language

Use Case:
Build tension before peak.

6. Layer Addition

Definition:
Add harmony or rhythmic layer on cue.

Constraints:

Layer pre-composed

No free vocal texture

Maximum 3 simultaneous layers

Use Case:
Pre-EDM build.

7. Controlled Sample Capture

Definition:
Short audience phrase recorded and looped.

Constraints:

1–3 seconds max

Leader-approved content

Inserted into pre-mapped rhythmic slot

No open-mic solos

Use Case:
EDM Peak integration.

Tier 3 — Restricted Modes (Limited Use Only)

These can destabilize scale if overused.

8. Free Text Contribution (Pre-Show Only)

Definition:
Audience submits words before event.

Constraints:

Pre-screened

Integrated into A/B options

Not live-generated

9. Physical Spatial Shift

Definition:
Audience moves position in room to represent choice.

Constraints:

Used only in low-density settings

Clear return-to-neutral cue

Explicitly Prohibited

The following are not allowed:

Open-mic improvisation

Freeform rhythmic invention

Drum circle energy

Leaderless singing

Harmonic invention from audience

Live lyrical generation without structure

Extended solo moments

If the crowd begins inventing structure, the leader immediately returns to Tier 1 mode.

Recovery Hierarchy

If participation destabilizes:

Return to Unison Repeat

Lock tempo with percussion cue

Reduce layers

Remove voting

Transition to next stage
